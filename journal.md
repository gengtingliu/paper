Moduel-measurement comparison of 
Aircraft measurements of

Secondary organic aerosol measurements over west Africa.

# Abstract
How do particles from forest fire emissions?

# Introduction
we present measurements of SOA from aircraft over W Africa.
J. Bloggs et al already took some measurements there, but they haven't answered all the sientific questions.
Of course, J. Smith et al made some great measurements in the 1980s in this region.

# Methodology
we used an aerosol mass spectrometer to measure

# Simulations
John has a great module which simulates
particle information from forest fire emissions.

# Results
we got vauable insight into the particle 
formation process.

# Conclusions
Aren't we great we found out some stuff.

# Figures
This is where the figures go
- fig 1
- fig 2

# Acknowledgements
We thank the EU for the funding grant.
